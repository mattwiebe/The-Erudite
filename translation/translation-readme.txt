=== Translations ===

This folder contains the source files for the translations provided with The Erudite. The the-erudite.pot file included here should be used for generating your translations.

For a useful guide on creating translatons, see:

**Note: after you get poEdit up and running, you may skip straight to Step 2, as the .pot file is already generated and included.

Once you've saved your .po and .mo files, place the .mo file in the /translation directory of The Erudite. You should now be localized.

If you've made a translation, get in touch and let's get your translation into the theme! http://somadesign.ca/contact/
